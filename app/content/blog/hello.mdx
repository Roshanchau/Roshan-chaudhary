When you run a Node.js program on a system with multiple CPUs, it creates a process that uses only a single CPU to execute by default.
Since Node.js uses a single thread to execute your JavaScript code, all the requests to the application have to be handled by that thread running on a single CPU.
If the application has CPU-intensive tasks, the operating system has to schedule them to share a single CPU until completion. That can result in a single process getting overwhelmed if it receives too many requests, which can slow down the performance. If the process crashes, users won’t be able to access your application.


As a solution, Node.js introduced the `cluster` module, which creates multiple copies of the same application on the same machine and has them running at the same time.
It also comes with a load balancer that evenly distributes the load among the processes using the round-robin algorithm. If a single instance crashes, users can be served by the remaining processes that are still running.
The application’s performance significantly improves because the load is shared among multiple processes evenly, preventing a single instance from being overwhelmed.
